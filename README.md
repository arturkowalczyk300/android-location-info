# Description

Program allows to get current user location from GPS. There is also possibility to share current position, for example through SMS in emergency situation.  

# Install
Download and install newest LocationInfo*.apk file from **Releases** section (*install from unknown sources* option must be enabled in settings of Android system).

# Todo
I'm planning constant development of this project. In closest future I want to add following features:
