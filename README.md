**LocationInfo** is application for devices with Android operating system which uses **Jetpack Compose** toolkit to present layout.  
Program allows to get current user location from GPS. There is also possibility to share current position, for example through SMS in emergency situation.  

# Todo
I'm planning constant development of this project. In closest future I want to add following features:

- [ ] Add more information (like number of available satellites and quality of signal)
- [ ] Possibility to save favorites location to local database
